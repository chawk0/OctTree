function naming pairs:

	init/cleanup		// for large systems and stuff?

	create/destroy		// for abstract things like render objects?

	load/clear		// moreso for data just loaded into memory?

	alloc/free		// for Array<>



size identifier naming:

	length			// for raw byte data buffers

	size			// for lists and containers of objects

	count			// specifically when a count is being tallied



class definition:

	bring in the public/private parts, tab in 1

	NO CODE AT ALL, only declarations.

	trim down includes to only what that class needs

	initializer lists!

	rule of 3?

	use destroy/cleanup/etc function in destructor and "clean" flag?

	APPLY CONST AS NEEDED, const refs, const funcs, etc

	prefer object pointers to statically instantiated members



other codey goals:

	try to incorporate try/catch on critical fails, otherwise...

	CREATE NIFTY LOGGING CLASS

	REWRITE TEXTURE AND MESH

	unify the geometric types into one Geometry.h
